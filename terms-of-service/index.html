You agree that you are not a joint venturer, franchisee, partner, agent or employee of Bindery Books, and you will not represent yourself as such.</p>

<h3>Payments to Tastemaker.</h3>

<p>As a Tastemaker, you have the ability to make offerings available on the Services, including, but not limited to, subscriptions automatically renewing on a monthly basis. Bindery Books handles payments issues, such as fraud, chargebacks, and resolution of payment disputes with End Users. We try to provide timely access to the revenue that you have earned through Bindery Books, but you may occasionally experience delays in accessing any such revenue. We may withhold access to your revenue where you have offered a physical benefit to a subscriber that has not yet been delivered.  We may also block or withhold access to your revenue for violations of this Agreement or other policies, or for compliance reasons, including collecting tax reporting information. When this happens, Bindery Books will do its best to communicate the reason to you promptly. If you have questions about access to revenue being blocked or withheld, please reach out to us at payments@binderybooks.com. In order to protect Tastemakers, we may block End Users’ payments if we believe them to be fraudulent. If your Account balance becomes negative, we reserve the right to recover those amounts from future payments of revenue.</p>

<p>For each subscription purchased by an End User for Your Content, the price of the subscription (excluding any sales tax) will be allocated as revenue attributable the Tastemaker (“Your Allocated Revenues”).  There are three fees/costs associated with your offerings and subscriptions on Bindery Books deducted from Your Allocated Revenues:</p>


<p>Bindery Books Platform Fee:  This fee is twenty-five percent (25%) of Your Allocated Revenues and covers the use of the Bindery Books Services;</p>

<p>Merchandise Costs: For subscription levels and types that include physical rewards, we charge you for the price of the merchandise and shipping identified on the merchandise page based on the quantity and SKUs of the associated items; and</p>


<p>Processing & Payout Fees: calculated as a fee per successfully processed payment from End User to Bindery Books, relating to Bindery Books’ cost of processing payments from End Users, including recurring billing, recovering declined payments, and fighting fraud; fees for transferring money you have earned on Bindery Books to your specified payout method (may vary based on your specified payout method); and conversion fees (calculated as a percentage) for payments made from End Users in currencies other than your payment currency;</p>

<p>Each Tastemaker must register with the third-party payment provider selected by Bindery Books, which Bindery Books may change in its sole discretion. Tastemakers may not use a payment provider other than the one selected by Bindery Books. Each Tastemaker must provide the payment provider any information required in order to receive payments via the payment provider, e.g., information about the bank account that the Tastemaker owns at a regulated financial institution. Any payments due to Tastemaker from Bindery Books will be made via the payment provider. If available, Tastemaker may transfer funds from its Bindery Books account to Tastemaker’s bank account by submitting a payment request. Tastemaker’s request will be processed by the payment provider. If not available, Bindery Books will submit the payment request, for processing by the payment provider. In addition, Bindery Books may, in its sole discretion, transfer funds from a Bindery Books account to a Tastemaker’s bank account especially in the case of account inactivity. If a Tastemaker does not provide the payment provider with all required information, a Tastemaker may not be able to receive the payments due to such Tastemaker. Bindery Books will not be responsible for any damages, delays, losses, costs, expenses, or liabilities arising out of or in connection with Tastemaker’s inability to receive payments as a result of Tastemaker’s failure to provide such information. Tastemaker acknowledges and agrees that Bindery Books does not operate, own, or control the payment provider; and Tastemaker’s use of any payment provider is subject to the terms and privacy policies of that payment provider. Tastemaker agrees that Bindery Books is not responsible for any delay, failure, damage, or liability caused by a payment provider, any other third party, a force majeure, or Tastemaker’s failure to timely or properly set up an account with the payment provider or otherwise provide requested information for payment. Other than with respect to any payment to or deduction by the application platform (as set forth in Section 4.2(b). Bindery Books will be responsible for fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the payment provider selected by Bindery Books. Unless otherwise agreed by Bindery Books in writing, Tastemaker acknowledges and agrees that Tastemaker is solely responsible for any other fees, costs, and expenses, including with respect to Tastemaker’s bank account and foreign exchange fees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms, if Bindery Books, in its sole discretion, believes that any fraud, money laundering, or other violation of law or regulation is taking place on or in connection with our Site, Tastemaker acknowledges and agrees that Bindery Books may withhold, delay, or seek repayment of any payments we believe, in our sole discretion, are related to the violation.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy our tax obligations, Bindery Books may collect tax identification information from Tastemakers, and, in certain circumstances, report this information and earnings to tax authorities, as legally required. For example, if you are located in the United States or are a United States citizen who has earned $600 or more, Bindery Books is required to issue you a Form 1099-K at year end. For purposes of Forms 1099-Ks, Bindery Books treats all Tastemaker earnings as earned for the sales of goods or services. As a Tastemaker, you are responsible for reporting any income, withholding, or other earnings-based taxes which may be due as a result of money you have earned on the Bindery Books Properties.  We are additionally responsible for a number of transactional taxes across the world. These include, but are not limited to, Valued Added Tax (“VAT”), Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) and other local service or sales taxes in non-US locations (collectively referred to as “VAT”), as well as Sales Tax (as defined below). In locales where we are required to collect transaction tax from patrons, invoices presented to and payments processed from patrons will include the tier or custom payment amount plus the applicable tax. Applicable tax will be charged in addition to the price of a relevant transaction based upon the benefits that you indicate that you will be offering to End Users. We will use the benefit categories that you assign to your subscription or offering to calculate, collect, and remit the applicable taxes. Tastemakers are responsible for ensuring that all of their benefits are properly categorized using good faith efforts and to the best of their abilities. Once settled, the tax amount will be automatically deducted from Tastemakers’ earnings, and we will remit directly to the applicable taxing authority. A record of the transaction tax portion of the payment will be available on your earnings details page. Tastemakers agree that they will provide us with any information and documents for accurate tax determination and compliance, where and as we request, or as otherwise required.</p>

<p>End User Payments, Fees, Subscription Terms and Physical Benefits.</p>

<p>Subscriptions. To enjoy full access to the Bindery Books Properties, End Users need to sign up for a subscription. A subscription starts on the date that an End User signs up for a subscription and submits payment via a valid Payment Method (defined below) or reactivate a pre-existing subscription. Unless we otherwise communicate a different time period to you at the time of sign up or otherwise (such as a multi-month commitment plan), each billing cycle is one month in length (a “Subscription Cycle”). Your Bindery Books subscription automatically renews each month, and we will automatically bill the monthly subscription fee to your Payment Method each month, until your subscription is cancelled or terminated.</p>

<p>Physical Benefits (Including Books).  Some Bindery Books subscription tiers include physical benefits (like books or acknowledgements in books) once certain subscription requirements are met by the End User.  Physical benefits are related to books in the process of publication and are tied to certain publishing milestones.  An End User is eligible to receive a physical benefit (like a book, bookmark, sticker or acknowledgement in a book), if (1) the End User subscribes to a subscription tier offering a physical benefit (including a book), (2) the End User has subscribed to such subscription tier for three (3) consecutive months, (3) the End User is an active subscriber to such subscription tier at the time the publishing milestone specified in the offer is met, and (4) the End User resides in a territory to which Bindery ships (currently the USA and Canada only).  If an End User cancels or does not renew their subscription prior to reaching the publishing milestone, the End User will not receive the physical benefit.  An End User must be an active subscriber to the relevant subscription tier at the time the publishing milestone is met in order to receive the applicable physical benefit. If the End User switches to a subscription tier that does not include a particular physical benefit, any progress toward earning that physical benefit is lost (even if the subscriber rejoins the original tier).</p>

<p>RECURRING BILLING. BY INITIATING A SUBSCRIPTION WITH BINDERY BOOKS, YOU AUTHORIZE US TO CHARGE YOU FOR YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND A RECURRING MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE AT THE THEN CURRENT RATE, WHICH MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME. YOU AUTHORIZE US TO CHARGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD FOR SUCH VARYING AMOUNTS, WHICH MAY BE BILLED MONTHLY IN ONE OR MORE CHARGES. YOU ALSO AUTHORIZE US TO CHARGE YOU ANY OTHER FEES YOU MAY INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE BINDERY BOOKS PROPERTIES, SUCH AS ANY APPLICABLE SIGN-UP FEE, TAXES AND CANCELLATION OR LATE FEES, AS FURTHER EXPLAINED BELOW. NOTE THAT EVEN IF YOU DO NOT USE THE SUBSCRIPTION OR ACCESS THE BINDERY BOOKS PROPERTIES AND/OR ANY CREDITS WITH BINDERY BOOKS, YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUBSCRIPTION FEES UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, OR IT IS OTHERWISE TERMINATED.</p>

<p>SUBSCRIPTION CYCLE. WHEN YOU SIGN UP AND PURCHASE YOUR BINDERY BOOKS SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR FIRST SUBSCRIPTION CYCLE WILL BE BILLED IMMEDIATELY. UNLESS WE EXPRESSLY COMMUNICATE OTHERWISE, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW EACH MONTH AND YOU WILL BE BILLED ON THE SAME DATE EACH MONTH. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE TIMING OF OUR BILLING (AND IF WE DO, WE WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS WE CHARGE, AS APPROPRIATE). IN THE EVENT YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEGAN ON A DAY NOT CONTAINED IN A GIVEN MONTH, WE MAY BILL YOUR PAYMENT METHOD ON A DAY IN THE APPLICABLE MONTH OR SUCH OTHER DAY AS WE DEEM APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU STARTED YOUR BINDERY BOOKS SUBSCRIPTION ON MARCH 31, YOUR NEXT PAYMENT DATE IS LIKELY TO BE APRIL 30, AND YOUR PAYMENT METHOD WOULD BE BILLED ON THAT DATE.</p>

<p>Taxes. The payments required under Section 5.1 of this Agreement do not include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement. If Bindery Books determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with this Agreement, Bindery Books shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under Section 5.1 of this Agreement. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Bindery Books, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Bindery Books for any liability or expense Bindery Books may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Bindery Books’ request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</p>

<p>Shipping.  Any physical benefits earned by subscribers will be shipped by a third party carrier. As a result, title and risk of loss for such merchandise will pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.   Unless otherwise indicated at the time of your subscription or at the time the physical benefit is announced, shipping and handling fees are included with the physical benefit. Shipping dates and/or arrival times are only estimates.</p>

<p>We are neither responsible nor liable for any delays or failures in performance from any cause beyond our control, including, but not limited to acts of God, changes to law or regulations, embargoes, war, terrorist acts, acts or omissions of third-party providers, riots, fires, earthquakes, floods, power outages, strikes, weather conditions or acts of hackers, internet service providers or any other third party, or your acts or omissions. Repeated claims of undelivered or missing physical benefits once shipped by Bindery Books may result in the cancellation of your subscription or refusal to process future transactions.</p>

<p>Refunds; Returns; Disputes. Generally, our fees and the value of products are nonrefundable unless we specifically communicate otherwise at the time of purchase. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS. You must notify us in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Billing disputes should be notified to Bindery Books at billing@binderybooks.com.  We do not currently accept returns of any physical benefits you may earn from your Subscription, and any physical benefits returned by an End User will not be eligible for a refund. In the case that your physical benefit does not arrive or a product is damaged, we must be notified via email at info@binderybooks.com within four (4) weeks of receiving your tracking information. If we are not notified within that time frame, we can no longer be held accountable for the missing or damaged items and will not be able to offer a replacement or refund. Please note that orders may take two (2) weeks to fulfill from the time of shipment. All refunds are granted at the sole discretion of Bindery Books.</p>

<p>In the event that Bindery Books is unable to fulfill any physical benefit, Bindery Books may credit an End User an amount, in its sole discretion, in lieu of the physical benefit.</p>

<p>PRICE CHANGES. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ADJUST PRICING AT ANY TIME. UNLESS WE EXPRESSLY COMMUNICATE OTHERWISE, ANY PRICE CHANGES TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL TAKE EFFECT ON YOUR NEXT BILLING CYCLE UPON NOTICE COMMUNICATED THROUGH A POSTING ON THE BINDERY BOOKS WEBSITE OR SUCH OTHER MEANS AS WE MAY DEEM APPROPRIATE FROM TIME TO TIME, SUCH AS EMAIL. IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THESE NEW FEES.</p>

<p>PAYMENT METHODS. You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (“Payment Method”). We may update the accepted Payment Methods from time to time. YOU MAY EDIT YOUR PAYMENT METHOD INFORMATION BY LOGGING ONTO THE SERVICES AND EDITING IT IN YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF A PAYMENT IS NOT SUCCESSFULLY SETTLED DUE TO EXPIRATION, INSUFFICIENT FUNDS OR OTHERWISE, YOU NONETHELESS WILL REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UNCOLLECTED AMOUNTS AND AUTHORIZE US TO CONTINUE BILLING THE PAYMENT METHOD OR ANY OTHER PAYMENT METHOD YOU HAVE PROVIDED, AS IT MAY BE UPDATED, INCLUDING IN THE EVENT YOU ATTEMPT TO CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT, REACTIVATE THE UNSETTLED ACCOUNT OR SIGN UP FOR A NEW ACCOUNT. THIS MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE TO YOUR PAYMENT BILLING DATES. IF WE CANNOT CHARGE YOUR ACCOUNT, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, BUT ARE NOT OBLIGATED, TO TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO OUR SITE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF.</p>


<p>CANCELLATION OF SUBSCRIPTION. UNLESS WE COMMUNICATE OTHERWISE, YOU MAY TERMINATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME BEFORE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION RENEWS BY GOING INTO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE SERVICES AND LETTING US KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO CANCEL. UNLESS WE COMMUNICATE OTHERWISE, FOLLOWING ANY CANCELLATION YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE END OF YOUR CURRENT PREPAID SUBSCRIPTION CYCLE, UNLESS YOU CANCEL AND RECEIVE A REFUND IN WHICH CASE YOUR ACCESS WILL BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR IT IS TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON, YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ALL CONTENT, CREDITS OR FEATURES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SUBSCRIPTION (INCLUDING ALL PHYSICAL BENEFITS NOT YET SHIPPED OR OTHERWISE FULFILLED).</p>

<p>Relationship of the Parties. Any agreements created between an End User and a Tastemaker are not binding on us. We are not liable for, or obligated to enforce, any agreements between an End User and a Tastemaker, including with respect to any Content to be provided by a Tastemaker. You will not consider Bindery Books, nor will Bindery Books be construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Bindery Books receives some form of remuneration in connection with the transaction, and Bindery Books will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.

<p>Arbitration Agreement. Please read the following arbitration agreement in this section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires that you and Bindery Books arbitrate disputes against one another. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS SECTION 18 CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING HOW DISPUTES THAT YOU AND BINDERY BOOKS HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS SECTION 18 INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WHICH REQUIRES, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND BINDERY BOOKS BE RESOLVED BY BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. THIS SECTION 18 ALSO CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 18 CAREFULLY.</p>

<p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Bindery Books agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services or the Agreement and prior versions of the Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and Bindery Books may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you or Bindery Books may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Informal Dispute Resolution. There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Bindery Books. If that occurs, Bindery Books is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Bindery Books agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Bindery Books therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p>

<p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Bindery Books that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to info@binderybooks.com. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, email address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute.</p>

<p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p>

<p>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND BINDERY BOOKS HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Bindery Books are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the subsection entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>

<p>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. YOU AND BINDERY BOOKS AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THE SUBSECTION ENTITLED “BATCH ARBITRATION”, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection, “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Bindery Books agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Bindery Books from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p>

<p>Rules and Forum. The Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and Bindery Books agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf.</p>

<p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</p>

<p>If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</p>

<p>Unless you and Bindery Books otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration” is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.</p>

<p>You and Bindery Books agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p>

<p>Arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration” is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.</p>

<p>Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” including any claim that all or part of the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief” is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief” has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration,” all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration.” The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Bindery Books need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution Process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p>

<p>Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Bindery Books agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Bindery Books by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).</p>

<p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Bindery Books.</p>

<p>You and Bindery Books agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</p>

<p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p>

<p>30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: Bindery Books, Inc., 584 Castro Street, San Francisco, California 94114-2512, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products distributed through the Services or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to Agreement) remain in full force and effect.
