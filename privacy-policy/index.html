Metadata includes information on how, when, where and by whom a piece of content was collected and how that content has been formatted or edited. Metadata also includes information that users can add or can have added to their content, such as keywords, geographical or location information, and other similar data.</p>

<p>Other data not specifically listed here, which we will use as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.</p>

<p>Third-party sources. We may combine personal information we receive from you with personal information that we obtain from other sources, such as:</p>

<p>Public sources, such as government agencies, public records, and other publicly available sources.</p>

<p>Partners, such marketing partners and event co-sponsors.</p>

<p>Tastemakers, to the extent tastemakers provide information concerning their followers.</p>

<p>Service providers that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Service or our business.</p>

For example, we may receive your personal information from an entity we acquire or are acquired by, a successor, or assignee or any party involved in a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, and/or in the context of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.</p>

This data may include your username, profile picture, posts and other content and information associated with your account on that third-party service that is made available to us based on your account settings on that service.</p>

<p>Automatic data collection. We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Service, our communications and other online services, such as:</p>

<p>Device data, such as your computer or mobile device's operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.</p>

<p>Online activity data, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, the website you visited before browsing to the Service, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times and duration of access, and whether you have opened our emails or clicked links within them.</p>

<p>Communication interaction data such as your interactions with our email, text or other communications (e.g., whether you open and/or forward emails) – we may do this through use of pixel tags (which are also known as clear GIFs), which may be embedded invisibly in our emails. </p>

<p>For more information concerning our automatic collection of data, please see the Tracking technologies section below.</p>

<p>Data about others. We may offer features that help users invite their friends, contacts or followers to use the Service, and we may collect contact details about these invitees so we can deliver their invitations. Please do not refer someone to us or share their contact details with us unless you have their permission to do so. </p>

<p>Tracking Technologies</p>

<p>Cookies and other technologies. Some of the automatic collection described above is facilitated by the following technologies:</p>

<p>Cookies, which are small text files that websites store on user devices and that allow web servers to record users’ web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites include both “session cookies” that are deleted when a session ends, “persistent cookies” that remain longer, “first party” cookies that we place and “third party” cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place. </p>

<p>Local storage technologies, like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.</p> 

<p>Web beacons, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.</p> 

<p>For information concerning your choices with respect to the use of tracking technologies, see the Your choices section, below.</p>

<p>How we use your personal information</p>
